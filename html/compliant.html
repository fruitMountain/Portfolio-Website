            <h1>ME 404/504 - Compliant Mechanisms</h1>

            <p>In Fall of 2018 I was a part of University of Idahos first semester of Compliant Mechanisms, a course to teach students the mechanics of extremely high deformation devices. The course involved a semester long project redeveloping a product with compliance and my group chose to make a guitar capo.</p>

            <p>
                <div class="citation">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="column"><img alt="compliant capo" src="../img/capo3.jpg" style="width:100%;"/></div>
                        <div class="column"><img alt="traditional capo" src="../img/capo.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div>
                    </div>
                    Figure: Left is a traditional guitar capo, while on the right is a compliant capo. The traditional capo has several independent parts, including a spring. The compliant capo however is a single piece made of PETG.
                </div>
            </p>

            <p>A traditional guitar capo costs, usually, between $10 and $20. The model we made could be injection molded in a single shot, bring materials, manufacturing, and assembly costs all to an absolute minimum (neglecting the cost of the mold). The same idea could be made to 3D print, as our team used as prototypes.</p>

            <p>
                <div class="citation">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="column"><img alt="Moment of Inertia vs. Force" src="../img/capo4.jpg" style="width:100%;"/></div>
                        <div class="column"><img alt="Angle of Arm vs. Force" src="../img/capo5.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div>
                    </div>
                    Figure: These are two graphs produced by my mathmatical model of the capo. The left helped me to size the capo by relating bending force to the moment of inertia, "I", of the bending arms. The left graph shows how changing the unstressed angle of the lower arm effects the neccessary force to open the capo.
                </div>
            </p>

            <p>After our team decided on a general design I was in charge of developing mathmatical models in python to optimize the dimensions of the compliant "hinges" with regards to fatigue life and the force needed to open the capo. I was able to use what we covered in class to choose the appropriate dimensions and material for the capo so that it could be opened with a reasonable amount of force and hold the strings down on a guitar. You can see a full report of the work we did <a href="../resources/compliant-report.pdf">here.</a></p>
