            <p>
                My name is Seth Berryhill and I am a recent mechanincal engineering graduate from The University of Idaho. I have a <a href="resources/resume.pdf">resume</a>, and I've worked on a few <a href="html/projects.html">projects</a>, but I am most excited about learning new things. I taught myself HTML and CSS in order to write this website, and everything here from photos to projects were made by me as well.
            </p>

            <p>I am interested in applying engineering concepts to create change in peoples lives. Whether that be in autonomous aircraft for land conservation, climate monitoring high altitude balloons, or prosthetics, I believe that the world is waiting for the application of modern technology to catch up with the progress seen around the world in engineering skills and tools for developing new ideas.
